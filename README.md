##Usage

### Build (tested with go 1.5.3)
```
$godep go build
```

###Just push to cloudfoundry
```
$cf push application-name -b go_buildpack -m 128M
```




## TBD / idea
* Add Signal handler and so on. (listenAndService is too simple)
* Embedded service-broker
* More Configuration
* Worker / pool (offload work)
